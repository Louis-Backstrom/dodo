## Note

Adapted from Supplementary Table 1 in Lees et al. (2021). Almost all
specimen records are considered certain, while sight and
literature-based records are all considered uncertain. The controversial
specimen from 1991 is classified as uncertain. Records have been
deduplicated to ensure they are all independent from one another.
Records without a date are not included.
