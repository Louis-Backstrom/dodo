# Solow's (1993) "Bayesian" model

Equation 3 and others from Solow 1993. Estimates a Bayes factor and
posterior probability that the species is extant at the test time.

## Usage

``` r
SO93B1(
  records,
  init.time = min(records),
  test.time = as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")),
  pi = 0.5
)
```

## Arguments

- records:

  sighting records in `ccon` format (see
  [`convert_dodo`](https://louis-backstrom.github.io/dodo/reference/convert_dodo.md)
  for details).

- init.time:

  start of the observation period. Defaults to the time of the first
  sighting, in which case this sighting is removed from the record.

- test.time:

  end of the observation period, typically the present day (defaults to
  the current year).

- pi:

  prior probability that \\H_0\\ is true (defaults to \\\pi = 0.5\\).

## Value

a `list` object with the original parameters and the Bayes factor and
p(extant) included as elements.

## Note

All sighting records are assumed to be certain and sampling effort is
assumed to be constant. The Bayes Factor presented here is the inverse
of the Bayes Factor as presented in the original paper, to allow for
comparability with other models in this package (values \> 1 imply
extinction).
