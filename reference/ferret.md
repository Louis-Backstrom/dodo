Black-footed Ferret (*Mustela nigripes*) sighting record from Solow
(1993) based on data provided by the US Department of the Interior,
processed into various `dodo` formats. The temporal range (`init.time`
to `test.time`) of these data is either 0 to 229 (`ccon`) or 1972 to
1992 (`cdis`). Formats: `ccon`, `cdis`.

## Usage

```

## Format

A `list` with 2 elements.

## Note

Times for `ccon` represent months post January 1972 (e.g. June 1972 is
6).
