\usage{
JR14F1(
  records,
  alpha = 0.05,
  init.time = min(records$time),
  test.time = as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{records}{sighting records in \code{ucon} format (see
\code{\link{convert_dodo}} for details).}

\item{alpha}{desired significance level (defaults to \eqn{\alpha = 0.05}) of
the \eqn{1 - \alpha} confidence interval.}

\item{init.time}{start of the observation period. Defaults to the time of
the first sighting, in which case this sighting is removed from the record.}

\item{test.time}{end of the observation period, typically the present day
(defaults to the current year).}
}
\value{
a \code{list} object with the original parameters and the p-value, point
estimate, and confidence interval included as elements. The confidence
interval is a two-element numeric vector called \code{conf.int}.
}
\description{
Equations 7-10 from Jarić & Roberts 2014. Estimates a p-value for testing
competing hypotheses of extinction/non-extinction, and a one-tailed
\eqn{1 - \alpha} confidence interval and point estimate on the time of
extinction. Sighting uncertainty is incorporated.
}
\note{
Sampling effort is assumed to be constant. Although the method in Jarić &
Roberts 2014 is theoretically applicable to other base models, this package
only includes the Solow 1993a variant, as it is the focus of the original
paper.
