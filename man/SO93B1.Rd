\usage{
SO93B1(
  records,
  alpha = 0.05,
  init.time = min(records),
  test.time = as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y")),
  pi = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{records}{sighting records in \code{ccon} format (see
\code{\link{convert_dodo}} for details).}

\item{alpha}{desired threshold level (defaults to \eqn{\alpha = 0.05}) of
the \eqn{1 - \alpha} credible interval.}

\item{init.time}{start of the observation period. Defaults to the time of
the first sighting, in which case this sighting is removed from the record.}

\item{test.time}{end of the observation period, typically the present day
(defaults to the current year).}

\item{pi}{prior probability that \eqn{H_0} is true (defaults to
\eqn{\pi = 0.5}).}
}
\value{
a \code{list} object with the original parameters and the Bayes factor
and p(extant) included as elements.
}
\description{
Equation 3 and others from Solow 1993. Estimates a Bayes factor and
posterior distribution on probability that the species is extant, with
associated point estimate and two-sided \eqn{1 - \alpha} credible interval.
}
\note{
All sighting records are assumed to be certain and sampling effort is assumed
to be constant.

\examples{
# Run the Caribbean Monk Seal analysis from Solow 1993
SO93B1(monk_seal, test.time = 1992)
# Run an example analysis using the Slender-billed Curlew data
\dontrun{SO93B1(curlew$ccon, init.time = 1817, test.time = 2022)}
