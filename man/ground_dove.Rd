\description{
Purple-winged Ground Dove (\emph{Paraclaravis geoffroyi}) sighting records from
Lees et al. (2021).
}
\note{
Adapted from Supplementary Table 1 in Lees et al. (2021). Almost all specimen
records are considered certain, while sight and literature-based records are
all considered uncertain. The controversial specimen from 1991 is classified
as uncertain. Records have been deduplicated to ensure they are all
independent from one another. Records without a date are not included.
